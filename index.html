				<h1></br></br>At Cr8ech Solutions & Projects believe that:</br></br></h1>
						
						<p>An effective website needs to be more than just a 
						pretty face. As well as looking good, it should be 
						simple for you and your colleagues to use; it should be 
						easy for your web users to find what you want them to find.

						We strive to design good looking, 'sexy' websites which are 
						visually stunning and friendly to both humans and search engines. 
						Whether it is a static HTML based website or a feature rich Flash site,
				 		when it comes to world-class web 
						designs, you can trust us to deliver you simply the best.</p>

				<h3>In our perspective:</h3></br></br> 
						<p>a website should have a unique personality
						which apparently stands out. Websites ought to be extremely effective
						and are well thought out.

						Of course, good design is subjective,
						however we spend much of our time seeing what resonates, 
						I think we have developed some aesthetic sense for what works.
						Consequently, we have developed four guiding principles that I 
						believe form the core of any successful Web site—usability, aesthetics,
						visibility, and flexibility. These aren't just buzzwords; combined, these
						are a comprehensive set of blueprints needed to craft a Web presence that
						will positively impact business. So no need to mention I do adhere with this.</p></br></br>

		<p style="color:#FF851B; font-size:20px;">Cr8ech solutions and projects(Pty) Ltd is a registered website and graphics corporation 
			that offers small businesses
			the opportunity to expand their business online and to reach more people, this hereby 
			increase business productivity and may boost sales.</br></br>
			The company was started in the year 2016, which was first an idea between two  determined, motivated and young
			individuals, who sat down to put their ideas on paper. Then after they went on to register the company Cr8ech solution 
			and projects.</br></br>
			Over the times we have been questioned about how the name 'Cr8ech' came about and the meaning of the name.
			Well, the name Cr8ech is a unique combination of two word which are create and tech. the '8' in cr8ech is what
			bonds the two words. The '8' takes the place of the letters 'eate' in 'create' and the 't' in 'tech'. 
			Many individuals have asked:"but what is it mean?", and our response has always been:"what does google,samsung and yahoo mean?".
